# Simple Universal React Redux Boilerplate
### The simplest Universal React & Redux boilerplate I could work out how to make.

This repo is an attempt to make the simplest server-side rendered (universal) React app.
It was born out of frustrations with complex boilerplates where you can't understand what is going on behind the scenes.

It tries to be as unopinionated and simple as possible.

It borrows heavily from the fantastic documentation of Redux and React-Router.

### These are the technologies it uses:

#### For the app
React
Redux
React-router
Express

#### Build tools
Babel for ES6 Javascript
Webpack 4
Sass

## Commands
To clone:
`git clone`

To develop:
`npm run dev`

To build for production:
`npm run build`

To run in production:
`npm run start`
